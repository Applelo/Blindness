# Blindness - PSP & PSVita

## About

Originally developed on PSP and ported to PSVita, Blindness is little addictive game where the rapidity and the memory are very useful. You need to use the joystick to navigate through the screen like an eye which move in the darkness. In game, you use your buttons (cross, circle, square and triangle) to correspond the shape in the screen with your "eye" to grab all the shapes present on the screen.
The game proposes 4 different cool modes:

* Black & White: The original mode with only one color, you need to change only your eye shape
* Colorful: Original mode with 3 different colors (red, green, blue), you need to change your eye shape and color.
* Recto Black & White: You don't need to choose your shape! Just grab shape which correspond with your eye.
* Recto Colorful: You don't need to choose your shape or your color! Just grab shape which correspond with your eye.

The difficulty is progressive.

Warning : This game is not recommended to people who suffers from photosensitive epilepsy because they are some effect which create epileptic crisis... Sorry.

This game is available in English & French and for PSP and PSVita/PS TV.
