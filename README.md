Blindness, a Game on PSP (PlayStation Portable)
Available later for PS Vita 

I'm present today my new contributions for PSP Scene : Blindness. I have this idea with the use of the joystick to navigate through the screen such as a eye who move in the darkness. It is a little addictive game where the rapidity and the memory are very useful.

Warning : This game is not recommended to people who suffers from photosensitive epilepsy because they are some effect which create epileptic crisis... Sorry.

The game propose a tutorial and the english and french language. You can also deactivate the joystick to the directional axe that will cause you less finger cramp.
